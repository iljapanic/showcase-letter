'Ilja took a group of coding novices and steered them through the process of using github and coding in HTML/CSS. Keeping the class in step, and in great humour, he left no-one behind and left none frustrated or waiting on others. He took all manner of questions in his stride and although the workshop was a long one every one of us was thrilled at the end. For me, Ilja delivered both technical instructions and, more importantly, technical understanding, and he did this with a keen eye on the students comprehension and progress. I was delighted to have taken part.'
