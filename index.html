                        <p>Dear [[WHOM IT MAY CONCERN]],</p>
<p>Some time ago you put up a notice for a [[JOB POSITION]] at [[COMPANY]]. My heartbeat went through the roof when reading it. I was looking for a way to get into design/UX education for a while now and this sounded like a perfect opportunity. However, I decided to postpone sending a cover letter until I finish my studies at CBS. I see that you have moved a long way since then. </p>
<p>I may not fit your new [[JOB POSITION]] profile. But nevertheless, I will try to convince you of my qualities in hopes that you will find a room for me in your organization.</p>
<h2 id="me-design-design-education">Me, Design &amp; Design Education</h2>
<p>My first entry into the realms of “formal” design was through self-study of UX about 5 years ago. Through UX, I got into Web design and eventually to a broader field of human-centered design. It was when I first read Papanek’s Design for the Real World that I started to grasp the true significance of design and the impact it has on our lives and environment. From here on design became a passion – something I know I will pursue for the rest of my life is some form or another.</p>
<p>My track record is mostly on a technical side of things. However, after many years of self-study, complimented with formal education and relevant work experience, I believe I’ve built a strong enough sense for design to be able to share it with others. My design education culminated when I wrote a bachelor project about Information Design as an alternative design mindset to Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
<p>I’ve self-organized a hands-on Web design workshop for people from my program at CBS. To my delight, the workshop was met with very positive feedback. I’m already in the process of organizing more workshops in near future. To take it a step further, I’ve also recently started building a community website to create an international framework for workshops that I hope to develop long-term. It’s safe to say this goes hand-in-hand with what [[COMPANY]] does.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-want-to-work-with-you">Why I want to work with you</h2>
<p>I believe a road to a better World is paved with an honest design that is sensible to human scale. A design that is focused on people, their lives, and their environment. Not on technology, which is merely one of the components in a designer’s toolbox. Design with people, not for people.</p>
<p>A lot of people are intimidated by design. They feel like design is something reserved only for a small elite we call designers. This misconception is one of the major failures of the modern educational system. Every child is born a designer. But through schools and institutions we systematically repress this creative part of the human mind.</p>
<p>I want to work with you to promote human-centered design and help others find their lost inner designer. We are all designers and world will be a better place if more people embrace this fact.</p>
<p>I want to engage with [[COMPANY]] on every possible level to spread awareness about good design, teach others the value of people-oriented design and to promote the organization along the way.</p>
<p>I would like to run workshops, help prepare course materials, assist senior members and coach the junior ones. I would also like to foster partnerships with like-minded organizations and present at meetups and conferences. I’m also more than happy to get my hands dirty with code. I’m ready to tackle any challenge you put in front of me.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-">What’s next?</h2>
<p>I’m freshly graduated and excited to start working full time on something I genuinely care about. [[COMPANY]] and what you stand for is currently that something and I would love to be a part of it.</p>
<p>If this letter sparked your interest, I would love to meet up with you and have a chat.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

                            <p>&#39;Ilja took a group of coding novices and steered them through the process of using github and coding in HTML/CSS. Keeping the class in step, and in great humour, he left no-one behind and left none frustrated or waiting on others. He took all manner of questions in his stride and although the workshop was a long one every one of us was thrilled at the end. For me, Ilja delivered both technical instructions and, more importantly, technical understanding, and he did this with a keen eye on the students comprehension and progress. I was delighted to have taken part.&#39; </p>
